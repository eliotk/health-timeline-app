# Sample CCDA Documents
### (Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture)

### What
This is a repository to collect **Sample CCDA Documents**. (No protected health information.)

### Why?
*Lots* of people will be implementing CCDA very soon; many have already started.
But there are big questions about how to do what, and while an excellent 
implementation guide is a must, examples matter too.  The community would
benefit immensely from a public collection of examples that can be:
 * dissected,
 * discussed, and 
 * corrected over time.

The goals are to provide:
 * examples for the developer community 
 * a platform to identify and correct implementation errors
 * a public arena to identify areas of ambiguity and variability

### Why not?
If there are barriers (organizational, technical, cultural, or otherwise),
can we break them down? [Discuss](https://github.com/chb/sample_ccdas/issues).

### How?
*All comers welcome*! To contribute samples, just:
 1.  Fork this repository to your GitHub account
 2.  Add an example file
 3.  Issue a GitHub "Pull request"

... or just share by e-mail with `joshua dot mandel at childrens.harvard.edu`

### Fine print
Sample documents should be available under an open license and should not 
involve PHI.  Ideally these documents would represent actual output of 
real export pipelines.
